<H1 class="text-2xl text-center font-bold text-blue-900">CHOOSING THE RIGHT ADVISOR</H1> 
<h2 class="text-2xltext-center font-bold text-blue-900">Preamble</h2> 
 <p>Many a times people tend to have many issues in life relating to certain things happening to them and people around them. And in the process, the worst of it all is that they fail to get the answer to their many questions. I am not insinuating to say that, (in this small mock-up), that I will give out a remedy to many of such ‘many questions ’, but essentially I am trying to pose a great concern to my readers in the same ambit.
 <br> There has come a time where you have a myriad of events taking place in your life, some of which you cannot fathom their origin, causes and the reasons for their happening. Consequently, you totally fail to get the approach with which to handle such a monster.  All you see ahead is a big mountain, which seems never to be brought down by anything! Therefore, in the same line, you begin to throw hands and head in the air, and fatigue catches up with you then suddenly, a thud!
   <br> In life, you will meet people of different caliber. You will encounter the good and bad. The optimistic in life, you will as well meet those who have lost hope in life. You will meet people of all types; the tall and dwarfs, well-educated and learned cartels, on the very same time you will meet those with no academic prowess.  Listen. Upon your time of distress, many people will pass by you as you are wallowing in the huge pool of helplessness and each and every one of them will at least try to throw a ‘word of encouragement’ to have you ease the somber and the painfully stinging melancholy.
   <br> Many will come and go. Others will make many turns so as to make sure they keep you warm… What am I saying here then? That in life, you need to be extremely very observant in all things you do, keeping a close look in everything happening about you.
    You deeply feel desperate and helpless when in a hard situation which requires an attention. And in this disposition, you tend to give in to anything and anybody that you feel and purport to unlock you from the current sordid situation. You will welcome any sort of advice and words of encouragement from whomever. The world seems to be totally against you. What will you do then?
    Not all who come do so for good. Everybody has his/her own reasons for coming. Are you sure that that party with whom you are sharing your story is honest and can keep your bond till the end of the story? How and what have known them to be? How strong is your trust in him/her? How confident are you that indeed that is the rightful individual to chat with about you state?
   <br> Indeed you will have to ask yourself a myriad of these questions in your hot pursuit of your relief.  People are different and sorry to say, are no longer trustiable. Humanity has left people and only infidelity occupies the hearts of men. You will sit down for a good and quality time and talk about issues ailing your heart. He/she will listen as you talk. You will express the whole of your heart and speak volumes. But guess what? The outcome might even hurt you more. You will no longer feel the sense of living. 
    Below here, I will bring you some of the key things to consider when choosing the right source of advice.   
<br><br> 
<img class="w-full" src="/public/images/critical thinking.jpg" alt=""> 
<br> 
<h2 class="text-2xl text-center font-bold text-blue-900">1. Think critically and wisely</h2>
<p>It is quite possible for you to know if the person you are seeking advice from is trustworthy or not. For instance, given that you know him/her, and that is the driving factor that made you make your way to them, this can easily make you draw you conclusions towards the end point. You therefore need to think beyond your ability before choosing your adviser bearing in mind that the information you are to disclose is personal, confidential and requires a special attention. Some people end up cracking shoulders with their advisers, causing hatred, un-forgiveness and eventually the worst thing does happen.</p>
<br><br>
<img class="w-full" src="/public/images/like minded.jpg" alt=""> 
<br><h2 class="text-2xl text-center font-bold text-blue-900">2.Be Similar-minded</h2><br> 
<p>Make sure that the person offering advice to you has the same personality with yours i.e. you share some qualities in common. This can only be achieved after understanding “who” he/she is. Choose one that can respect your opinions, beliefs, values, strengths and weaknesses and the differences that you might be having. One that can uphold integrity as far as your confidentiality is concerned.
   <br><br> A good adviser will put him/herself in your shoes. Feels what you feel, sees the way you see, laugh when you laugh and also cries whenever you do so. He or she should bear the fact that you are a substance of change to the society when you are out of the problem since you will also help others who face the same. </p>
   <br><br>

<br> 
<h2 class="text-2xl text-center font-bold text-blue-900">3. Know your problem area</h2><br>
<p>Many people experience tough times in life and fail to recognize the monster itself. Am sure you have ever come to that position of losing track of what exactly is your troubling problem. You need to understand at the first place, the nature of your problem. Consider if it is a psychological or mental disturbance, health issues, spiritual unrest or even financial challenge. Upon you now having this relevant knowledge, you will now be at the rightmost position to tackle your problem. You can deploy a professional to intervene especially in cases where you need mental or psychological advice. The right person you choose will automatically lead to a successful outcome.</p>
<br><br> 
<img class="w-full" src="/public/images/communication.jpg" alt=""> 
<br> 
<h2 class="text-2xl text-center font-bold text-blue-900">4. Have basic and appropriate communication skills</h2><br>
<p>Sometimes people fail to achieve what they want due to failure to communicate efficiently and effectively. You may want to seek some help through verbal communication and fail to communicate in a manner that can attract relevant and useful solutions. In expressing your issues to the adviser, make sure that you do so, keeping in mind the following; Audibility of your voice, facial expression to emphasize your point, maintain your eye contact with the adviser to avoid one of you  loosing tack, exhibit  general body language and always be confident in raising your issues. By so doing, you will be propelling the adviser to get intimately impressed and get you helped.      

    If you implement the above hunks, then you will be at a better position of clearing the messes that you face.</p>
