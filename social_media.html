<H1 class="text-lg text-center font-bold text-blue-900">EFFECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS</H1>  
<p>As we continue to envisage what the world is turning into, we now find ourselves in the world of digitalism, where everything is literally run online. It is clear, however, that even learning has been made digital, and every learner is expected to adjust into the new system. Social media has played a significant role in shaping up the lives of many university students world over, some get affected positively while others negatively. It defines the time spent in a day-long, as well as what happens in the cool nights. Some of these social media sites typically include social networking(Face book, LinkedIn, and Google+), Micro Blogging(Twitter), Photo Sharing sites(Instagram, Pinterest, Snap Chat), and Video sharing sites, which entails Youtube, Vimeo, FaceBook Live, and Periscope.
    <br><br><h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">Easy Access to information</h2>
    
    Every human being can access the required information without any limitation whatsoever.
    Also, in the learning procedure; communication, and in particular, ICT, can be one of the major determinant factors to attain success in the learning process. (Abbas and Abdulnaser, 2020).
    Having this fact in mind, we are now able to understand why many higher learning institutions have embraced the new move of digitalism. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn have of recent proven to be the best approach for delivering knowledge through a wide span of space and time. University students have now found it easier to chat with their instructors more conveniently on topics of discussion that mostly require online meet-ups. There is access to live video discussions. Students can also share learning materials through platforms, for instance, WhatsApp and Facebook.
    <br>
    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">Bold Self-expression</h2>
    
    Furthermore, social media has now provided for the most convenient place for students to express themselves and share out their ideas and shortcomings in no longer a big deal for most ‘cowardly’ students in the university. It is clear that some students feel ashamed and/ or undermined when standing before their colleagues to make a statement at any level. Being in aWhatsApp group or a FaceBook page/forum encourages anonymity of participants; hence, one feels secure to share any form of material which seems helpful to others, some of which contain humorous contents. Social media has helped a great deal in doing away with the old methods where students had to wait for an opportunity to participate in an event and showcase their talents ( Emertxe , 2019).
    
    <h2 class="font-bold text-1xl text-blue-900">Source of extra income</h2>
    
    Many students in the higher learning institutions nowadays go through a major challenge of financial constrain, and many of this lot includes those from poor background families. Thanks to some online groups that have come up with small gigs where someone gets paid by clicking on links, viewing videos, creating email addresses, and many more opportunities that have been
    seeing students carry on with campus life.
    <br>
    
        <br><br> Social media, however, has demonstrated a great impact on many of the university-age students.
    The negative effects that range from crime, sexual perversion, moral decay, as well as university policy breaching is a matter of serious discussion in many of the communities world over today.
    
    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">Examination irregularities.</h2>
    
    It is no doubt that most students spend much of their times scrolling their phones, visiting all social media sites, hence get less time to study. The end result is that they get stuck during exams which finally force them to involve in exam irregularities. The punishment is normally unbearable and regrettable!
    
    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">Moral decay</h2>
    
    Many of the universities, almost all provide for their students free Wi-Fi to successfully facilitate the learning process. The sad thing is that the granted opportunity is misused by some of the students in visiting pornographic sites, and reading promiscuous contents, hence erode their virtues.
    
    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">Increase in social crimes</h2>
    
    With the presence of online movies downloading sites, some of which offer free movies like hoopla, Plex, IMDb TV, and many more, students come across many movies which have explicit contents. The contents they get from the movies negatively affects their mentalities and behaviour, hence drives some into engaging in robbery and other irresponsible deeds.
    
    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900">Conclusion</h2>
    
    The use of social media is good, but when it is misused then it becomes a tragedy to the community and the world at large. Learning has now been made easier and convenient. The freedom of expression is demonstrated in the social media platforms, while on the other hand,the world has witnessed a great erosion of morality among university-aged students due to the negative effects of social media.</p>
